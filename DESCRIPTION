Description: Stratigraphic ranges of fossil marine animal genera from Sepkoski's
    (2002) published compendium. This version of the dataset is a port of
    Shanan Peter's online database (<http://strata.geology.wisc.edu/jack/>). No
    changes have been made to any taxonomic names. However, first and last
    appearance intervals have been updated to be consistent with stages of the
    International Geological Timescale 2022.
