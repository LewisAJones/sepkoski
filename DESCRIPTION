Description: Stratigraphic ranges of fossil marine animal genera from Sepkoski's
    (2002) published compendium. This version of the dataset is a port of
    Shanan Peter's online database (<http://strata.geology.wisc.edu/jack/>). No
    changes have been made to any taxonomic names. However, first and last
    appearance intervals have been updated to be consistent with stages of the
    International Geological Timescale 2022. Functionality for generating a plot
    of Sepkoski's evolutionary fauna is also included.
